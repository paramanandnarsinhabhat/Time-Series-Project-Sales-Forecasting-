Problem Statement
SimpleBuy is a clothing company. Be it parent, child, man, woman, they have wide range of products catering to the need to every individual. They aim to become one stop destination for all clothing desires.
 
Their idea of offline and online channels is doing quite well. Their stock now runs out even faster than they could replenish it. Customers are no longer skeptical about their quality. Their offline stores help customer to physically check clothes before buying them, especially the expensive clothes. In addition, their delivery channels are known to achieve six sigma efficiency.
 
However, SimpleBuy can only provide this experience, if they can manage the stocks well. Hence, they need to forecast the sales ahead of time. And this is where you will help them in collecting the raw material and planning the manufacturing process. SimpleBuy has provided you with their Sales data for last 2 years and they want to you predict the sales for next 6 months.
